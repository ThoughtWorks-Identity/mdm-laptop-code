# This example script uses the caffeine command to ensure the machine never
# goes to sleep. You should be very careful with this script if you call it
# from another script as it will more than likely pause your entire workflow
# until the caffeination is over. InstallApplications can handle this by
# passing the "donotwait" key in the json payload.
